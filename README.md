# react-material-router-alt
Experimenting with React, Material-UI, React Router, Alt, with some Mongoose and Express on the side.

I also have a pretty neat hacked-together Gulp build process that uses BrowserSync as a proxy over the Express server, doing rebuilds and refreshes with Browserify/Watchify for the app and Nodemon for the server.
